User Registration and Login System
This project is a user registration and login system developed using Java Servlets. It allows users to create accounts and securely log in to access the application. The application connects to a MySQL database to store user data, ensuring that user information is managed effectively.

Features
User Registration: Users can create new accounts by providing their name, email, and password. User Login: Registered users can log in using their credentials. Session Management: The system utilizes HTTP sessions to maintain user login status, ensuring a secure and seamless user experience. Error Handling: Users receive feedback on registration and login attempts, enhancing usability.

Technologies Used
Java Servlets: For handling HTTP requests and responses, allowing dynamic web content generation. MySQL: For storing user data, including names, emails, and passwords. HTML/CSS: For creating the user interface of the registration and login pages.

Future Enhancements
In the future, the application will implement Argon2 password hashing for improved security. This enhancement will ensure that user passwords are stored in a secure manner, further protecting user data.
